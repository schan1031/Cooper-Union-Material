This is an implementation of Leo Breiman's
ringnorm example[1]. It is a 20 dimensional, 2
class classification example. Each class is drawn
from a multivariate normal distribution. Class 1
has mean zero and covariance 4 times the
identity. Class 2 has mean (a,a,..a) and unit
covariance. a = 2/sqrt(20). Breiman reports the
theoretical expected misclassification rate as
1.3%.
