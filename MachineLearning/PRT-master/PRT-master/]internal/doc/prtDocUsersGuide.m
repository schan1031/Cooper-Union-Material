%% The Pattern Recognition Toolbox Users Guide
%
% The Pattern Recognition Toolbox Users Guide begins with an introduction
% to the various dataset objects that are necessary to perform
% classification or regression. 
%
% * <./prtDocDataSet.html Pattern Recognition Toolbox DataSets>
%
% The next topic is the Pattern Recognition Toolbox Engine, which discusses
% the syntax for prtAction objects. This syntax is common for most of the
% functionality in the Pattern Recognition Toolbox.
%
% * <./prtDocEngine.html Pattern Recognition Toolbox Engine>
%
% Following, Classifiers and Pre-processing techniques are presented. 
%
% * <./prtDocClass.html Pattern Recognition Toolbox Classification Objects>
% * <./prtDocPreProc.html Pattern Recognition Toolbox Preprocessing Objects>
%
% Algorithm objects allow multiple prtActions to be connected together,
% and use the same training, running and evaluation syntax as a single
% prtAction.
%
% * <./prtDocAlgorithm.html Pattern Recognition Toolbox Algorithm Objects>
%
% Regression is similar to classification, but maps observations to a
% continuum of numbers, as opposed to a discrete set of class labels.
%
% * <./prtDocRegress.html Pattern Recognition Toolbox Regression Objects>
%
% Clustering is also closely related to classification, however, in
% clustering, class labels are not used during training.
%
% * <./prtDocCluster.html Pattern Recognition Toolbox Clustering Objects>
%
% Scoring and evaulation provide methods to analyze the results of your
% classification, regression or clustering. Scoring functions work on
% prtDataSets, while evaluation functions work on prtAction objects.
%
% * <./prtDocScore.html Pattern Recognition Toolbox Scoring functions>
% * <./prtDocEval.html Pattern Recognition Toolbox Evaluation functions>
%
% Decision objects take the outputs of a prtAction object and make
% decisions according to particular criteria, such as the minimum probability
% of error. 
% 
% * <./prtDocDecision.html Pattern Recognition Toolbox Decision Objects>
%
% Kernels are useful in many nonlinear classification and regression
% problems. The Pattern Recognition Toolbox provides a suite of common
% kernels to be used in conjunction with prtClass and prtRegress objects.
%
% * <./prtDocKernel.html Pattern Recognition Toolbox Kernel Objects>
%
% The Pattern Recognition Toolbox also provides a set of distance
% functions, such as Euclidean, Mahalonobis and other distance metrics, to
% be used in conjunction with prtActions.
%
% * <./prtDocDistance.html Pattern Recognition Toolbox Distance Functions>
%
% Random variables often form important components of prtActions, and a
% set of random variable objects is provided.
%
% * <./prtDocRv.html Pattern Recognition Toolbox Random Variable Objects>
%
% Feature selection is a technique that helps select the features that
% have the greatest effect on the performance of prtActions. 
%
% * <./prtDocFeatSel.html Pattern Recognition Toolbox Feature Selection Objects>
%
% Often, data collected from real world applications may contain outliers
% that are not relevant, and that may skew results. The Pattern
% Recognition Toolbox provides a set of outlier removal objects.
%
% * <./prtDocOutlierRemoval.html Pattern Recognition Toolbox Outlier Removal Objects>
%
% The Pattern Recognition Toolbox provides a set of data
% generation functions, which can be useful for creating example or
% prototying.
%
% * <./prtDocDataGen.html Pattern Recognition Toolbox Data Generation Functions>
%
% Finally, the Patern Recognition Toolbox provides support for developing
% and implementing your own features.
% 
% * <./prtDocAddYourOwn.html Developing and testing your own algorithms>
