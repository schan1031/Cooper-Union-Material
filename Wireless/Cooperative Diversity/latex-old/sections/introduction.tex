\IEEEPARstart{W}{ireless} ad-hoc networks have recently become a topic of research as they can be deployed quickly in locations lacking the infrastructure required for typical wireless networks.
Compared to the transmitters and receivers in traditional wireless networks, the nodes in an ad-hoc network may be much smaller and possibly mobile.
This discourages the use of many techniques for increasing capacity, most notably the use of multiple antennas at the transmitter for obtaining a diversity gain.
A diversity strategy is proposed in \cite{4686273} that creates a virtual antenna array by utilizing inactive neighboring nodes in transmitting with an orthogonal space-time block code.
