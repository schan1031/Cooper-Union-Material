We implement a cross-layer design utilizing a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) on the transport layer to detect poor channel state and Alamouti's space-time block code on the link layer for retransmission.  Diversity nodes are selected at the transport layer, rather than the link layer, reducing the channel quality estimation to a CRC.  We also simulate different methods of selecting retransmission nodes by taking into account likelihood of retransmission.
