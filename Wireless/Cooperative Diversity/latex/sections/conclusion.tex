In this paper, a relatively low complexity method of obtaining transmitter-side diversity gain in an ad-hoc network by use of cooperative diversity without necessitating antenna diversity at any node was simulated.
The source node transmitted packets along with a CRC allowing for low complexity selection of cooperative diversity candidate nodes at the transport layer without any explicit knowledge of channel state at any other nodes.
If the destination node failed the CRC, a candidate was selected to retransmit the packet along with the source node using Alamouti's rate 1 space-time block code.
This method proved to significantly increase throughput.
In addition, intelligent selection of candidate nodes based on maximum likelihood of successful transmission further increased the throughput gains of this system.
Overall, cooperative diversity was shown to be an effective method of increasing throughput in ad-hoc networks.
