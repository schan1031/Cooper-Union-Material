We implement a cross-layer design utilizing a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) on the transport layer to detect poor channel state and Alamouti's space-time block code on the link layer for retransmission.
Retransmissions are performed with cooperative diversity, utilizing inactive nodes in a virtual antenna array.
Diversity nodes are selected at the transport layer, rather than the link layer, reducing the channel quality estimation to a CRC.
We also simulate different methods of selecting retransmission nodes by taking into account likelihood of retransmission.
We find that utilizing cooperative diversity significantly increases throughput, especially in shadow fading environments where all nodes do not have line of sight channels to all other nodes.
