Motorola DSP Linker,  Version 6.3.7, Sep 17 1999
An assembly file linked with a c generated file will 
inherit the Stack_space setting from the c file.
====
Motorola DSP Linker,  Version 6.3.6, Jul 26 1999
Corrections to SC100 linker strings. Does not
affect other devices.
====
Motorola DSP Linker,  Version 6.3.5, Jul 13 1999
Support for SC100 linker strings added. Does not
affect other devices.
====
Motorola DSP Linker,  Version 6.3.3, Apr 16 1999
Linker crashes if corrupt debug data exists in cln files.
Added checks to validate line number data before trying
to fix up line number addresses. Reason for corrupt
debug data is unknown.
====
Motorola DSP Linker,  Version 6.3.2, Apr 05 1999
Fixed more byte swap bugs in ELF support.
====
Motorola DSP Linker,  Version 6.3.1, Mar xx 1999
Fixed byte swap bugs in ELF support.
====
Motorola DSP Linker,  Version 6.3, Mar 19 1999
Added support for sc100 device.
====
Motorola DSP Linker,  Version 6.2.16, Mar 19 1999 
ELF debug file generation for Quartz processor.
====
Motorola DSP Linker,  Version 6.2.15, Dec 21 1998
Added MCM,NOMCM option. This allows modules which were not
assembled with the -c option to  link with modules which
were assembled with the -c option. Mainly, it lets symbols
whose storage class is C_EXT be resolved by symbols whose
storage class is A_XDEF. This is enabled by the -xmcm (mixed
c mode ) flag.
====
Motorola DSP Linker,  Version 6.2.14, Dec 16 1998
-Added more descriptive message to alignment error reports
====
Motorola DSP Linker,  Version 6.2.13, Dec 15 1998
-BUG121598_0: SC4 only: Fixed bt branch offset calculation.
evres.def.xvalue.mid value was incorrectly generated during symbol fixup.
-Corrected bitlength error in SZCK function. 
====
Motorola DSP Linker,  Version 6.2.12, Dec 14 1998
Fixed 20bit branch offset (bsr) symbol table value. This
is a generic problem in the way in which long (>16bit)
values were stored in the evres structure.
====
Motorola DSP Linker,  Version 6.2.11, Oct 19 1998
Changed max address to 32 bits for SC400.
====
Motorola DSP Linker,  Version 6.2.10, Oct 06 1998
Added support for long symbol reporting in map files.
The user must specify MAP OPT SYMLEN[=<arg>] in the linker
control file to get this capability.

For the "Symbol Listing by Name" report,
symbol names longer than 16 characters are printed on a
separate line from their corresponding data values.

For the "Symbol Listing by Value" report, a simple two column "value
and name" report is generated.
The traditional multi-column report is disabled by MAP OPT SYMLEN[=<arg>].

An optional numeric argument may be specified which prints
the specified number of symbol name characters in the two
reports mentioned above. If no numeric argument is specified, that is,
only SYMLEN is specified, the program will print up to 511 characters
in the reports. If the program is unable to parse the numeric
argument the SYMLEN defaults to 0, in which case the program
will print up to 511 characters. Numeric arguments may be specified
in decimal,octal (number preceded with 0),or hexadecimal values (number
preceded with 0x or 0X).
====
Motorola DSP Linker,  Version 6.2.9, Sep 28 1998
Added new alternate encoding function "aenc" for SC400
====
Motorola DSP Linker,  Version 6.2.8, Sep 18 1998
Changed SC400 to 400
====
Motorola DSP Linker,  Version 6.2.7, Sep 14 1998
You must specify -Xwdg in order to generate warnings for
duplicate globals in libraries. Otherwise, duplicate globals
are ignored, the first symbol which satisfies the external
reference is used as the value of the symbol.
====
Motorola DSP Linker,  Version 6.2.6, Sep 10 1998
Changed Quartz to SC400
====
Motorola DSP Linker,  Version 6.2.5, Aug 1998
Added magic number for 56700
====
Motorola DSP Linker,  Version 6.2.4, Aug 1998
Fixed PC only bug generated by 6.2.3, where swapw was called 
twice in get_symbuf.
====
Motorola DSP Linker,  Version 6.2.3, Jul 08 1998
Added checks for duplicate global symbols in library
modules. Linker issues a warning if multiply defined
global symbols exists in modules which are being linked.
====
Motorola DSP Linker,  Version 6.2.2, Jul 01 1998
Added a new modifier to the section directive. The section modifier
"debug" marks COFF section within a section/endsec block with the
STYP_DEBUG flag. At link time, the linker detects STYP_DEBUG type
COFF sections and keeps the original section name rather than
converting it to .txt or .dat. Note an absolute assembly is unchanged,
I did not modify the assembler to change section names.
====
Motorola DSP Linker,  Version 6.2.1, Feb 20 1998
Linker now generates DSIZE symbol accurately,
even when a non-C compiler generated file is included
in the linking process. See DDTS bug report QTKqa13111
for details.
====
Motorola DSP Linker,  Version 6.2.0, Jan 08 1998

Bug fixes.
====
Motorola DSP Linker,  Version 6.1.11, Jan 06 1998
1. Added support for checking operand sizes if the relocation expression 
	 contains '@SZCK' functions.
